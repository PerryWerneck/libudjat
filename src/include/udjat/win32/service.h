					//
					// Referring to SERVICE_CONTROL_PRESHUTDOWN:
					//
					// A service that handles this notification blocks system shutdown until the service stops
					// or the preshutdown time-out interval specified through SERVICE_PRESHUTDOWN_INFO expires.
					//
					// In the same page, the section about SERVICE_CONTROL_SHUTDOWN adds:
					//
					// Note that services that register for SERVICE_CONTROL_PRESHUTDOWN notifications cannot
					// receive this notification because they have already stopped.
					//
					// So, the correct way is to set the dwControlsAccepted to include either SERVICE_ACCEPT_SHUTDOWN
					// or SERVICE_ACCEPT_PRESHUTDOWN, depending on your needs, but not to both at the same time.
					//
					// But do note that you probably want to accept more controls. You should always allow at least
					// SERVICE_CONTROL_INTERROGATE, and almost certainly allow SERVICE_CONTROL_STOP, s
					// ince without the latter the service cannot be stopped (e.g. in order to uninstall the software)
